- O1 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C3 and C1
- O2 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C2 and C4

*Trials*
- SSVEP
    - Trial 1: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 3 times
        - "1-2-5s" means 1s rest + 2s cue + 5s stimulus
