### Session 1: Subject 003

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 37 cm
    - Midpoint: 18.5 cm
- Interauricular distance: 34 cm
    - Midpoint: 17 cm

*Electrodes*

| Channel  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6   | 7  | 8  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
| Location | C3 | C1 | O1 | Oz | O2 | N/A | C2 | C4 |
- Oz position: 10% of nasion-inion distance above inion (bump on the back of the head)
- O1 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C3 and C1
- O2 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C2 and C4

*Trials*
- Mu:
    - Trial 1: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
    - Trial 2: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
    - Trial 3: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- SSVEP
    - Trial 4: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times (random)
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
        - Purple electrode (channel 2, not used for SSVEP) fell off during trial
    - Trial 5: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times (random)
        - Channels: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
        - Turned off channel 2

*Remarks*
- Participant tied up their hair into pigtails
- For mu trials, participant had strong baseline alpha on both sides,
and was able to suppress one side by imagining left hand/arm movement,
and the other side by imagining right hand/arm movement

### Session 2: Subject 001

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 38 cm
    - Midpoint: 19 cm
- Interauricular distance: 38.5 cm
    - Midpoint: 19.25 cm

*Electrodes*

| Channel  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6   | 7  | 8  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
| Location | C3 | C1 | O1 | Oz | O2 | N/A | C2 | C4 |
- Oz position: 10% of nasion-inion distance above inion (bump on the back of the head)
- O1 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C3 and C1
- O2 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C2 and C4

*Trials*
- SSVEP
    - Trial 1: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times (random)
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5

*Remarks*
- Original csv file (001-trial1-ssvep-2019-8-29-19-2-36-BAD.csv) was empty because we forgot to start the OSC stream,
but since we had the txt file generated by the OpenBCI GUI and the timestamps saved by the dashboard, we were able to label the data. Good data file: 001-trial1-2019-08-29-FIXED.csv

### Session 3: Subject 006

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 38 cm
    - Midpoint: 19 cm
- Interauricular distance: 39 cm
    - Midpoint: 19.5 cm

*Electrodes*

| Channel  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6   | 7  | 8  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
| Location | C3 | C1 | O1 | Oz | O2 | N/A | C2 | C4 |
- Oz position: 10% of nasion-inion distance above inion (bump on the back of the head)
- O1 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C3 and C1
- O2 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C2 and C4

*Trials*

        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
        - Participant was physically clenching hand during trial, but it did not seem to have any effect
