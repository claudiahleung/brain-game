### Session 1: Subject 001

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 38.5 cm
    - Midpoint: 19.25 cm
- Interauricular distance: 38 cm
    - Midpoint: 19 cm

*Electrodes*

| Channel  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6   | 7  | 8  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
| Location | C3 | C1 | O1 | Oz | O2 | N/A | C2 | C4 |

        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
    - Trial 4: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times (random)
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Mu:
    - Trial 3: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8

*Remarks*
- Amplitude of time-series was high at baseline (around 10 microvolts)
- Participant's hair was tied (in pigtails) to facilitate placement of electrodes on back of head
