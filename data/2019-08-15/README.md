### Session 1: Subject 016

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 38 cm
    - Midpoint: 19 cm
- Interauricular distance: 39 cm
    - Midpoint: 19.5 cm

*Electrodes*

| Channel  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6   | 7  | 8  |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|-----|----|----|
| Location | C3 | C1 | O1 | Oz | O2 | N/A | C2 | C4 |
- Oz position: 10% of nasion-inion distance above inion (bump on the back of the head)
- O1 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C3 and C1
- O2 position: horizontally aligned with Oz, vertically aligned with the midpoint between C2 and C4

*Trials*
- Mu:
    - Trial 1: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 7, 8

        - Channels: 1, 2, 7, 8
- SSVEP
    - Trial 3: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5
        - SSVEP interface was buggy on Claudia's laptop, switched to Michelle's for Trials 4 and 5
    - Trial 4: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5
    - Trial 5: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5

*Head measurements*
- Nasion-inion: 37 cm
    - Midpoint: 18.5 cm
- Interauricular distance: 38 cm
    - Midpoint: 19 cm

*Trials*
- Mu:
    - Trial 1: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 7, 8
    - Trial 2: 30s Rest Left Right, 2 times
        - Channels: 1, 2, 7, 8
- SSVEP
    - Trial 3: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5
    - Trial 4: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times

    - Trial 5: 1-2-5s 10Hz 12Hz 15Hz, 5 times
        - Channels: 3, 4, 5

*Remarks*
- Tying the participant's hair into pigtails and having them sit closer to the screen (with brightness turned up) seems to give better results (when comparing PSDs with previous subjects' SSVEP trials)
